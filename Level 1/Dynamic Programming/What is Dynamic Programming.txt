Formal Definition:-
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given 
complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the 
results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.

Practical Definition:-
Dyanamic Programming is basically "enchanced recursion" 
or "memorized recursion"

When to use:-
"Choice+Optimal"

Properties:-
1) Overlapping Subproblems: 
2) Optimal Substructure: 
A given problems has Optimal Substructure Property if 
optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained 
by using optimal solutions of its subproblems. 

Approahes:-
a) Memorization (Top Down) 
b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)
