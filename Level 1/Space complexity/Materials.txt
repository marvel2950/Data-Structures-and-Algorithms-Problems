Space complexity

Space complexity is the total amount of extra memory space used by an algorithm/program excluding the space of input values for execution.


a = 5 
b = 5
c = a + b
print(c)

arr = []
for i in range(0,n):
    arr.append(i)

arr = []
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(0,n):
        arr.append(j)

arr = []
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        arr.append(j)

arr = []
i = 1
while i<n:
    arr.append(i)
    i=i*2
